Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, 
mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. 
These actions increase concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Consequences include rising sea levels, more intense heatwaves, and disruptions to ecosystems. 
Mitigation strategies involve renewable energy adoption, reforestation, and carbon capture technologies.
