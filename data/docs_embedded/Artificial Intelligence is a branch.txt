Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on building systems 
that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. 
Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. 
Deep learning models, such as neural networks, enable breakthroughs in image recognition, 
natural language processing, and generative content creation. 
Responsible AI emphasizes fairness, transparency, and accountability.
