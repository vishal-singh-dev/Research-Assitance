Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales. 
One of its most famous phenomena is quantum entanglement, where two particles remain correlated 
regardless of distance. This property challenges classical intuitions about locality. 
Quantum theory also introduces wave-particle duality, showing that light and matter 
can behave as both waves and particles depending on observation. 
Modern applications include quantum computing, cryptography, and precision measurement technologies.
